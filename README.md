 Cloudinary Watermark API with Laravel
</h1>

Cloudinary is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution for managing all your web or mobile application’s media assets in
the cloud. Cloudinary offers an end-to-end solution for all your image and video needs, including the upload, storage,
administration, transformation and optimized delivery.

Laravel is a PHP framework developed with developer productivity in mind. The framework also aims to evolve with the web and has already incorporated several new features and ideas in the web development world—such as job queues, **API authentication** out of the box, real-time communication, and much more.

## Introduction

In this article, we’ll explore the ways you can build a simple Cloudinary Watermark API using Laravel. The API will allow you to add a watermark to an image using Cloudinary's powerful transformational API. We’ll be using Laravel 8, and all of the code is available for reference on GitHub.

## Github

The final project can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com).

You can find the full source code on my [Github](https://github.com/victorokech/cloudinary-watermark-api) repository.

## Prerequisites

Using Cloudinary in your Laravel projects is pretty straightforward. However, for you to be able to easily follow along,
you need to have a good command of your terminal, Git and entry knowledge of PHP specifically with the Laravel
framework.

You also need to understand what a RESTful API is. REST stands for _REpresentational State Transfer_ and is an architectural style for network communication between applications, which relies on a stateless protocol (usually HTTP) for interaction.

Lastly, you will need an API Client/Platform such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) installed on your system to test the API endpoints.

## Getting Started

Being that Laravel is a PHP Framework, we will need Composer. Like any modern PHP framework, Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before we can
start ensure you have Composer installed on your machine. Follow step 1 below to install Composer and PHP.

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.tools.php) on
   your development or production machine.
2. Install Laravel
    1. Via Composer:
   
       `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel cloudinary-watermark-api`
    2. Via Laravel Installer
   
       `composer global require laravel/installer`
   
       `laravel new cloudinary-watermark-api`
3. In step 2 above we have installed the Laravel Installer and used it to scaffold a new application in the folder `cloudinary-watermark-api`. With Laravel installed, we should be able to start and test the server ensuring everything is okay. Change the directory to the project folder and run the local development server by typing the following commands:

   `cd cloudinary-watermark-api`

   `php artisan serve`

The Laravel Project is now up and running. When you open `http://localhost:8000` on your computer, you should see the image below:

![Laravel Server Running](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655887283/watermark-api/assets/laravel-running_zqk8ol.png)

## Routes and Controllers
In the `routes/` folder you will notice that Laravel has a couple of files. We will work with the `routes/api.php` file to create the routes we need for our API. 

For a start, we will need two endpoints, one to upload the watermark to Cloudinary and the other to create the watermark branded images, but you can add more routes you need as you continue exploring the Cloudinary APIs.

We have a route now we need to create a controller. Run the following commands to create one.

`php artisan make:controller WatermarkController`

This will create the controller `app/Http/Controllers/WatermarkController.php`

![WatermarkController](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655887282/watermark-api/assets/watermark_controller_axuzlv.png)

At the moment it is empty, but we will populate it shortly. First things first, let us setup Cloudinary 🙌🏾😊.

## Setting up Cloudinary’s Laravel SDK

Cloudinary has a tonne of features from media upload, storage, administration, manipulation to optimization and delivery. In this case we will use Cloudinary's transformation features to create an API endpoint that will automatically overlay a brand/watermark image over our media.

That way our media content will be authentic and super professional which is a requirement for excellent brand management

To get started:

1. Sign up for a free Cloudinary account then navigate to the Console page and take note of your Cloud name, API Key and
   API Secret.

   ![Cloudinary Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655887283/watermark-api/assets/cloudinary_dashboard_m5d8ye.png)

2. Install [Cloudinary’s Laravel SDK](https://github.com/cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel#installation):

   `composer require cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel`

**Note**: Please ensure you follow all the steps in the #Installation section. Publish the configuration file and add
the Cloudinary credentials you noted in Step 1 to the `.env` file.

## Creating the Watermark Endpoint

We will make use of the `WatermarkController` we had created earlier. It will take two required inputs from the `POST` request:

1. `watermark` - This is a required image input of type PNG, since we need our watermark to be transparent in order to overlay it over other images.
2. `public_id` - We need to implicitly provide the public id for our watermark since we will need to specify this when performing the overlay transformation later on.

Open the file `app/Http/WatermarkController.php` and add the following code:

1. First we create the function upload which will correspond to our `watermark/upload` end point.
```php
public function upload(Request $request) {

}
```

2. Add the functionality to validate the required inputs, upload the watermark to Cloudinary and send a response to the user. Here is how it works:
```php
public function upload(Request $request): JsonResource {
    // Validates the request from the user
    // If the validation failed, throw a ValidationException and inform the user.	
    $data = $this->validate($request, [
        'watermark' => [
            'required',
            'image',
            'mimes:png',
        ],
        'public_id' => [
            'required',
            'string'
        ]
    ]);
	
	// If there are no validation errors, proceed and upload watermark to Cloudinary and return a Json response to the user.		
    $watermark = $data['watermark'];
    $public_id = $data['public_id'];
    cloudinary()->upload($watermark->getRealPath(), [
        'folder'    => 'watermark-api',
        'public_id' => $public_id
    ])->getSecurePath();
    
    return JsonResource::make([
        'message'   => "Watermark created successfully",
        'watermark' => ['public_id' => $public_id]
    ]);
}
```
3. Now we can link this in the routes file. Open your `routes/api.php` and add the following code:

`Route::post('watermark/upload', [WatermarkController::class, 'upload']);`

**Testing:** You can test the route using Postman or Insomnia. Below is an example of a successful and failed response:

|![Successful API Response](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655895878/watermark-api/assets/api_successful_response.png) |
|---|
| Successful API Response |

|![Failed API Response](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655895361/watermark-api/assets/api_failed_response.png) |
|---|
| Failed API Response |

Awesome, moving on nicely.

## Creating the Overlay or Branding Endpoint

By now you know how to create an endpoint, this should be a breeze. We will use the same `WatermarkController` but create a new method for this endpoint.

Similar to the previous endpoint this one will also take two inputs:

1. `media` - This is a required image/video input. It is the media file that we want branded with our cool watermark, we created earlier.
2. `public_id` - This is the public id of the watermark we passed to the previous endpoint. This needs to be exactly the same to the one we provided previously.

In our WatermarkController add the following method:

```php
public function create(Request $request): JsonResource {

}
```

We will populate the create method above with the following code:

```php
public function create(Request $request): JsonResource {
  // Validation
    $data = $this->validate($request, [
        'media'     => ['required', 'image', 'max:1024'],
        'public_id' => [
            'required',
            'string'
        ]
    ]);
	
    // Uploading image to Cloudinary with transformation parameters that will overlay our watermark on our image		
    $media = $data['media'];
    $public_id = $data['public_id'];
    $branded = cloudinary()->upload($media->getRealPath(), [
        'folder'         => 'watermark-api',
        'transformation' => [
            'overlay' => $public_id,
            'gravity' => 'south_east', // watermark location bottom right
            'x'       => 0.02, // 2 percent offset horizontally
            'y'       => 0.02, // 2 percent offset vertically
            'crop'    => 'scale',
        ],
    ])->getSecurePath();
	
    // We return a response to the user with the URL of the branded or watermarked image		
    return JsonResource::make([
        'message' => "Watermark created successfully",
        'url'     => $branded
    ]);
}
```

**Important:** Take note of the following transformation that make the magic happen. Please refer to this [Cloudinary Layers documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/layers) to learn more about these transformation options and experiment with several other awesome features:
1. `overlay` - This is the public id of the watermark we uploaded earlier. Please note that since we provided a `folder_name` when uploading the watermark. We will need to include the folder name in the `public_id` input we send to the server, otherwise Cloudinary will look for the watermark in the root folder and not find it.
2. `gravity` - This is where the overlay will be placed. it can be center, north, south, east and so on and so forth.
3. `x` and `y` offsets - These parameters accept either integer values representing the number of pixels to adjust the overlay position in the horizontal or vertical directions, or decimal values representing a percentage-based offset relative to the containing image (e.g., 0.2 for an offset of 20%).

4. Install Livewire Package by running the following command in your Laravel project:
   `composer require livewire/livewire`


If you followed along this article keenly, you should be able to use an API client such as Postman or Insomnia to hit the endpoints to upload a watermark or create a watermarked/branded image similar to the one below:
